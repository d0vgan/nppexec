<h3>3.6. Execute NppExec Script...</h3>
<p>The &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog can be shown using its hotkey (F6 by default) or the menu item &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; in NppExec's submenu (Plugins -&gt; NppExec -&gt; Execute NppExec Script...).</p>
<p>The &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog allows to specify several NppExec's commands (one command per one line) which will be executed one after another. Such set of commands forms so-called NppExec's script. The script can be saved using the &quot;Save...&quot; button of the &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog.
      For example, you can create NppExec's script which makes a reserve copy
    of current file:</p>
<p>1) open the &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog
    and type the following</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>// save current file
NPP_SAVE
// copy current file to C:\Backup
cmd /c copy &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot; &quot;C:\Backup\$(FILE_NAME)&quot; /Y</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>2)
    press the &quot;Save...&quot; button, type &quot;Reserve Copy&quot; and press the &quot;Save&quot; button. </p>
<p>This example allows you to create
      and save NppExec's script named &quot;Reserve Copy&quot;. You can call this script later from the &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog. Also you can create a menu item for this script using NppExec's Advanced Options (Plugins -&gt; NppExec -&gt; Advanced
    Options...).</p>
<p>It is not necessary to save a new
      script each time you want to execute several commands. You can use the &quot;&lt;temporary script&gt;&quot; for commands you don't need to save. The temporary script is saved automatically when you close Notepad++. Also, if you modify commands of some saved script (e.g. if you modify the &quot;Reserve Copy&quot; script), it will be saved automatically when you close Notepad++. Or you can press the &quot;Save&quot; button
    to save it immediately.</p>
<p>You can delete previously saved
    scripts using the &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog. Press the &quot;Save...&quot; button (yes, the irony :)), select a script name and press the &quot;Delete&quot; button.</p>
