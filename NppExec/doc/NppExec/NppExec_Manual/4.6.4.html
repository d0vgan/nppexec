<h3>4.6.4. Running Python & wxPython</h3>

<p>1. Interactive Python inside NppExec</p>
<p>Running &quot;python -?&quot; gives the following help information, in particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-i : inspect interactively after running script, (also PYTHONINSPECT=x) and force prompts, <I>even if stdin does not appear to be a terminal</I></li>
  <li>-u : <I>unbuffered binary stdout and stderr</I> (also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x) see man page for details on internal buffering relating to '-u'</li>
</ul>
<p>The text in italic <I>exactly</I> refers to what is stated in NppExec's Manual, sections 1.3 and 3.1 by &quot;NppExec is not a console emulator&quot;.</p>
<p>So, by running &quot;python -i -u&quot; in NppExec's Console, you get the interactive Python inside Notepad++.</p>
<p>Here is an advanced example of NppExec's script to be used to test a Python's program interactively:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>npp_console -  // disable any output to the Console
npp_save  // save current file (a .py file is expected)
cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"  // use the current file's dir
set local @exit_cmd_silent = exit()  // allows to exit Python automatically
set local PATH_0 = $(SYS.PATH)  // current value of %PATH%
env_set PATH = $(SYS.PATH);C:\Python27  // use Python 2.7
npp_console +  // enable output to the Console
npp_setfocus con  // set the focus to the Console
python -i -u "$(FILE_NAME)"  // run Python's program interactively
npp_console -  // disable any output to the Console
env_set PATH = $(PATH_0)  // restore the value of %PATH%
npp_console +  // enable output to the Console</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>2. Python and UTF-8</p>
<p>If your python's program contains some non-ASCII characters, you can get the following error from Python: &quot;SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character&quot;.</p>
<p>To be able to represent such non-ASCII characters correctly on any system, 
such source file should be saved as UTF-8 (either without BOM or with BOM). 
Though the error mentioned above still remains. 
To avoid this error, acccording to http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ , 
you just need to specify</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre># coding=utf-8</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>at the beginning of your python's program.</p>
<p>Another thing is to output something to console as UTF-8.</p>
<p>In this case, you can get something similar from Python: &quot;UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 0-2: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>To fix this last one, it's enough to specify the environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING by setting it to &quot;utf-8&quot;. I.e.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>// within NppExec
env_set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python my_program.py</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <pre> </pre>

<p>3. Running Python scripts using wxPython</p>
<p><em>[the text below has been originally posted by cioma in NppExec's forum]</em></p>
<p>[ cioma: ]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use NPP as an IDE for Python. And I use NppExec to run scripts directly from NPP, highlight script syntax and runtime errors (if any) and link errors to a line of code. </p>
  <p>Some time ago I started using wxPython GUI library and faced problems with running such scripts from within NppExec. </p>
  <p>If I run this (in NppExec prompt): </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>python -t -B -u &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot; </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>...then GUI part of wxPython is not shown. I guess the reason is that wxPython requires a &quot;real&quot; console buffer and NppExec doesn't provide that. </p>
  <p>If I just run script over NPP &quot;Run&quot; dialog (no NppExec) then GUI is shown but if there are errors there is no way to easily relate them to line of code in NPP. </p>
  <p>So I found this solution to work: </p>
  <p>1. When creating wxPython application in the script make sure it's STDOUT is not redirected: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>app = App(redirect=False) </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. Run in NppExec: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>cmd /C python -t -B -u &quot;$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)&quot; </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Voila! We have both wxPython GUI running and its STDOUT redirected to NppExec. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ DV: ]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just one thing. For more details regarding runtime errors parsing (keyword: Highlight filters), refer to [4.7.4] and &quot;help con_filter&quot;. </p>
