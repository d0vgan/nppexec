 ChildProcess_StartupTimeout_ms
 ------------------------------
   This parameter is important when a child console process is created.
   The child process usually can't be created immediately, therefore
   we must give some time to this process to be started.
   Here is a general implementation of this part of code:

       if ( CreateProcess( ... , &ProcInfo ) )
       {
           CloseHandle( ProcInfo.hThread );
           WaitForSingleObject( ProcInfo.hProcess, STARTUP_TIMEOUT );
           ...
       }

   When the process is started, WaitForSingleObject returns.
   But, if the value of STARTUP_TIMEOUT is too low, WaitForSingleObject
   may return before the process is started.
   If default value of ChildProcess_StartupTimeout_ms is not enough for
   your PC, you can increase it. IMHO, it can not exceed 400 ms.


 ChildProcess_CycleTimeout_ms
 ----------------------------
   The only purpose of this parameter is to decrease the CPU usage.
   The bigger value you set, the less CPU usage you get :-)
   Here is an implementation of this part of code in outline:

       do {
           // reading from the process'es pipe
           ...
       } while ( WaitForSingleObject( ProcInfo.hProcess,
                     CYCLE_TIMEOUT ) == WAIT_TIMEOUT );

   Don't forget that actually the value of ChildProcess_CycleTimeout_ms
   is a pause between requests to the child console process'es output,
   so values > 500 ms are not recommended.


 ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms
 ---------------------------
   This parameter is needed when you are about to exit (quit) a running
   child console process by sending the exit command to it.
   For example, cmd.exe is running, but you want to close the Console
   window or start another NppExec's script. So, you send the exit
   command - and NppExec waits for the cmd.exe process to be finished.
   If the child process has been finished before the timeout of
   ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms elapsed, NppExec performs the action
   requested previously - closes its Console window or starts another
   script.
   Otherwise, if the child process has not been finished during
   ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms (for example, if "dir" has been sent
   instead of "exit"), then NppExec does not close its Console window
   or does not start another script after the child process will be
   finished at last.
   See also: 'ExitScript_Timeout_ms'.


 ChildProcess_KillTimeout_ms
 ---------------------------
   This parameter specifies a timeout to be used while trying to kill a running
   child console process.
   A child console process will be killed when the Kill button is pressed in
   the "exit command" dialog. If the process does not exit during this timeout,
   another kill method will be tried.
   If the attempts to kill the process did not succeed, the process will be
   terminated.


 ChildProcess_RunPolicy
 ----------------------
   This parameter specifies the policy used to run a child process.
   The following values are available:

   0 - pass the given command line to CreateProcess() as is.
       This policy has no overhead, but file extensions such as ".bat" or ".js"
       must be specified explicitly - or the "cmd /C" prefix should be used.
       Otherwise CreateProcess() does not know how to execute such files.

   1 - always obtain the file extension before passing the given command line
       to CreateProcess(). NppExec takes the first argument of the given
       command line and examines whether it already contains a file extension.
       If the file extension is not specified, NppExec examines the paths in
       the %PATH% environment variable, searching for a file with a given name
       and with an extension from the %PATHEXT% environment variable.
       This policy adds the overhead of searching for a file using the two
       loops: the outer loop of "for path in %PATH%" and the inner loop of
       "for ext in %PATHEXT%" each time you run a child process in NppExec.
       This implicit searching allows to execute files with extensions such as
       ".bat" or ".js" (without specifying their extension explicitly in the
       command line) by means of CreateProcess() - as the obtained file
       extension is implicitly added by NppExec.

   2 - always add the "cmd /C" prefix - unless "cmd" is explicitly specified.
       NppExec tries to use the %ComSpec% environment variable first and uses
       the hard-coded value of "cmd" only if %ComSpec% is empty.
       This policy adds the overhead of running the "cmd.exe" each time you
       run a child process in NppExec. This implicit invocation of "cmd.exe"
       allows executables and batch files to be run (started) in NppExec in the
       very same way as these files are run (started) in cmd's console. Also
       it allows to execute any cmd-specific command such as "time /t" or
       "for %f in (*.txt) do @echo %f" without the explicit "cmd /C" prefix
       as this prefix is added implicitly.
       Note: the "/C" switch is not hard-coded and can be changed via the
       advanced option "ChildProcess_ComSpecSwitches".


 ChildProcess_ComSpecSwitches
 ----------------------------
   The command line switch(es) to be used with %ComSpec% when the value of the
   advanced option "ChildProcess_RunPolicy" is set to 2.
   The default value is "/C".


 ChildScript_SyncTimeout_ms
 --------------------------
   When a new NppExec's script is about to be started while another one is
   still running, this timeout is used to wait for the running NppExec's script
   to end.
   If the already running script did not finish during this time, either
   "Another script is still running" is shown (if there is no child process
   running) or NppExec tries to end the currently running child process (if
   there is one).
   If the already running script has finished during this time (or the running
   child process has been finished), the new NppExec's script is started.


 ExitScript_Timeout_ms
 ---------------------
  NppExec uses this timeout to wait until the Exit Scripts ends. If it has not,
  NppExec does its best to abort the Exit Script (to avoid Notepad++ to hang).
  Note:
  If this value is less than the value of 'ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms', the
  value of 'ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms' is used instead. It's because the
  Exit Script potentially can run a child process, and in this case it needs
  at least 'ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms' timeout to end.
  See also: 'ChildProcess_ExitTimeout_ms'.


 Path_AutoDblQuotes
 ------------------
   If you enable this option (set it to 1), then path to executable
   which contains spaces (for example, "my program 1.exe") will be
   automatically enclosed in quotes "".
   It is disabled by default because of a bug with executables w/o
   extension. For example, this line

     cmd /c calc.exe

   will be modified (if this option is enabled) to this one:

     "cmd /c calc.exe"

   because "cmd" is given without extension ".exe".
   Therefore don't forget to enclose paths with spaces in quotes
   manually, when this option is disabled.


 CmdHistory_MaxItems
 -------------------
   Specifies maximum number of items in the console commands history.


 Exec_MaxCount
 -------------
   Specifies maximum number of NPP_EXEC calls within one script.
   This value is needed to prevent the infinite loop of several scripts
   which call each other, e.g.

     ::script1
     npp_exec script2

     ::script2
     npp_exec script1


 GoTo_MaxCount
 -------------
   Specifies maximum number of GOTO calls within one script.
   This value is needed to prevent the infinite loop e.g.

     :label1
     goto label1

   Note:
   You always can close the Console window to stop the running script.


 ExecText_MaxCount
 -----------------
   Specifies maximum number of NPP_EXECTEXT calls within one script.
   This value is needed to prevent the infinite loop of the commands
   such as:

     npp_exectext 0 $(SELECTED_TEXT)

   when the selected text itself contains the same command

     npp_exectext 0 $(SELECTED_TEXT)

   The same applies to the following command placed to the clipboard:

     npp_exectext 0 $(CLIPBOARD_TEXT)


 RichEdit_MaxTextLength
 ----------------------
   Specifies maximum number of characters which can be stored or
   pasted into the Console dialog's rich edit control.


 SendMsg_MaxBufLength
 --------------------
   Specifies maximum number of characters (buffer) allocated for
   string parameter(s) of NPP_SENDMSG or SCI_SENDMSG message.


 Calc_Precision
 --------------
   Calc result precision for "set <var> ~ <math expression>".
   The calc result will be rounded according to this value.
   The precision affects only the result representation,
   whereas all internal operations inside one math expression
   are not rounded.


 CommentDelimiter
 ----------------
   Specifies a comment delimiter  :-)  I.e. all characters after
   this delimiter are understood as a comment, and the text line
   (command) is truncated at the position of this delimiter.
   Exception:
   - when the comment delimiter is // then :// is not truncated
   at the position of // (because :// can be a part of http://).
   Note:
   - if you specify empty comment delimiter i.e.

     CommentDelimiter=

   then you can not use comments in your commands/scripts because
   there is no comment delimiter in this case.


 Visible
 -------
   If you enable this option (set it to 1), then the Console window
   will be visible when Notepad++ starts. Otherwise, when this option
   is set to 0 (default value), there will be no Console window opened
   when Notepad++ starts.


 ShowHelp
 --------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), the Console window shows
   the Help Info each time Notepad++ starts.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), the Console window does not
   show the Help Info when Notepad++ starts.


 PrintMsgReady
 -------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), a message "==== READY ===="
   is printed in the Console after an NppExec's script is executed.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), a message "==== READY ===="
   is not printed.
   Can be enabled/disabled via "npe_console p+/p-".
   See also: CustomMsgReady.


 CustomMsgReady
 --------------
   When PrintMsgReady is enabled (set to 1), the CustomMsgReady specifies
   the message to be printed in the Console after an NppExec's script is
   executed.
   The CustomMsgReady message supports special characters:
     \r - new line
     \t - tab character
     \\ - single \ character
   If you do not specify "\r" at the end of the CustomMsgReady message,
   NppExec's Console will not jump to the new line after this message is
   printed.
   The CustomMsgReady message also supports variables. For example:

     CustomMsgReady= === Ready, $(SYS.USERNAME)! ===\r

   or

     CustomMsgReady= === Done. Last process id is $(pid) ===\r

   See also: PrintMsgReady.


 NoEmptyVars
 -----------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), then all empty (uninitialized)
   variables such as "$(var)" will be replaced with "" (empty string).
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), then empty variable "$(var)"
   will not be replaced with empty string i.e. it will remain "$(var)".


 SaveCmdHistory
 --------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1) and "Console Commands History"
   is checked, then the console commands history is saved to file
   "npec_cmdhistory.txt" when Notepad++ exits. And the commands history
   is restored from this file when Notepad++ starts.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), then the console commands
   history is not saved and restored.


 TextColorNormal
 ---------------
   This option can specify the Console's normal text colour in a form of
   RR GG BB, where RR, GG and BB are HEX values of red, green and blue
   colours.
   Value of "00 00 00" or "000000" means RR = 00, GG = 00 and BB = 00
   i.e. black colour (because values of red, green and blue = 0x00).
   Value of "FF 00 00" or "FF0000" means RR = FF, GG = 00 and BB = 00
   i.e. red colour (red = 0xFF, green and blue = 0x00).
   Value of "0" or any other value which does not contain three values of
   relative intensities of red, green and blue colours means "don't use
   this value, use default colour". I.e. you can specify

     TextColorNormal=0

   or just

     TextColorNormal=

   to use the default (internal) colour.
   The same approach is used for TextColorError, TextColorMessage and
   BackgroundColor values.
   If you want to have a "console-style" look (i.e. white text on the
   black background), specify the values similar to:

     TextColorNormal=C0 C0 C0
     TextColorError=C0 10 10
     TextColorMessage=20 A0 20
     BackgroundColor=00 00 00


 TextColorError
 --------------
   This option can specify the colour of Console's error messages.
   See TextColorNormal for details.


 TextColorMessage
 ----------------
   This option can specify the colour of Console's internal messages
   (such as  "Process started >>>",  "======== READY ========"  etc.)
   See TextColorNormal for details.


 BackgroundColor
 ---------------
   Background color of the Console's output window.
   See TextColorNormal for details.


 Alias_Cmd_NppExec
 -----------------
   This alias can be used instead of the "NPP_EXEC " command when you
   want to execute some NppExec's script. The alias consists of one
   character; only the first character from specified string value is
   taken. For example,

     Alias_Cmd_NppExec=\!?

   sets the first character '\' as the alias, other characters are
   ignored. With this example, you can type

     \"my script" "param 1" "param 2"

   instead of

     NPP_EXEC "my script" "param 1" "param 2"

   and the script named "my script" will be executed.
   You can also specify an empty value of Alias_Cmd_NppExec:

     Alias_Cmd_NppExec=

   The empty value of Alias_Cmd_NppExec disables the alias i.e. no
   character can be used instead of "NPP_EXEC ".


 Key_Enter
 ---------
   Specifies the character(s) sent to stdin of the running process
   when the Enter key is pressed.
   Available values are: \n, \r, \r\n, \n\r and so on.
   In case of empty value, the default value of \n is used.


 Console_NulChar
 ---------------
   Specifies HEX code of a character shown by the Console instead of '\0'
   (NUL) - since '\0' itself is the null terminator of a null-terminated
   string.
   Unicode version of NppExec accepts either 2 bytes or 1 byte HEX code,
   e.g.:

     Console_NulChar=25E6  ; this is 0x25E6 - the "White Bullet" symbol

     Console_NulChar=0020  ; this is 0x0020 - the "space" symbol
     Console_NulChar=20    ; this is 0x20 - the same "space" symbol

     Console_NulChar=0017  ; this is 0x0017 - the "End of Text Block" symbol
     Console_NulChar=17    ; this is 0x17 - the same "End of Text Block"

     Console_NulChar=0000  ; this is 0x0000 - the NUL itself
     Console_NulChar=00    ; this is 0x00 - the same NUL

     Console_NulChar=      ; empty value (no value)

   ANSI version of NppExec accepts 1 byte HEX code,
   e.g.:

     Console_NulChar=17    ; this is 0x17 - the "End of Text Block" symbol

     Console_NulChar=20    ; this is 0x20 - the same "space" symbol

     Console_NulChar=00    ; this is 0x00 - the NUL itself

     Console_NulChar=      ; empty value (no value)

   The value of 00 disables the substitution of the NUL character. I.e. '\0'
   remains '\0', resulting the end of the null-terminated string.
   The empty value is treated as usage of the default substitute symbol:
   * it is 0x25E6 ("White Bullet") for Unicode version of NppExec;
   * it is 0x17 ("End of Text Block") for ANSI version of NppExec.


 NppExec_Cmd_Prefix
 ------------------
   Specifies a prefix to be used while executing NppExec's commands from a
   running console process.
   For example, 'cmd' or 'python -i -u' is running in NppExec's Console and
   you want to execute some NppExec's command without leaving 'cmd' or
   'python'. You can do it by specifying the NppExec_Cmd_Prefix:

     nppexec:echo Hello!          // prints "Hello!" in NppExec's Console
     nppexec:set local A = 3      // sets NppExec's local variable 'A'
     nppexec:NPP_EXEC "my script" // executes NppExec's script "my script"
     nppexec:help cls             // prints help on NppExec's command "cls"


 UTF8_Detect_Length
 ------------------
   Max length, in bytes, of a buffer to be used to detect UTF-8 without BOM
   while loading a text file via CFileBufT<wchar_t>::LoadFromFile - e.g. by
   CON_LOADFROM or SEL_LOADFROM.
   If a negative value is specified, the whole file content will be inspected
   (may be slow while loading big files).
   Setting this value to 0 disables UTF-8 without BOM detection.


 AnsiEscapeSequences
 -------------------
   Specifies what to do with ANSI escape sequences in the output text.
   Note: currently NppExec does not support ANSI escape sequences and treats
   them as additional characters. I.e. these sequences are not processed by
   NppExec to e.g. set text attributes, move the cursor and so on.
   AnsiEscapeSequences = 0  -  keeps raw ANSI escape characters "as is" (the
                               output text may contain extra characters from
                               the escape sequences, including unreadable ones);
   AnsiEscapeSequences = 1  -  removes ANSI escape characters (the output text
                               will not contain extra characters from the escape
                               sequences).
   Can be enabled/disabled via "npe_console e1/e0".

 ExecClipTextMode
 ----------------
   Specifies the text processing mode for Execute Clipboard Text.
   See the "c" parameter of NPE_CONSOLE ("help npe_console") for details.


 ExecSelTextMode
 ---------------
   Specifies the text processing mode for Execute Selected Text.
   See the "s" parameter of NPE_CONSOLE ("help npe_console") for details.


 KillProcTree
 ------------
   Kill process tree on/off.
   When this option is on (set to 1), killing a running child process (the one
   that runs in NppExec's Console) also kills any processes that were started
   from this running child process.
   Can be enabled/disabled via "npe_console j+/j-".


 Cd_UnnamedFile
 --------------
   When "Follow $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" is on and an unnamed file (e.g. "new 1")
   is activated, this option defines the exact behavior.
   When "Follow $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" is off, this option does nothing.
     Cd_UnnamedFile = 0  -  the current directory is not changed
     Cd_UnnamedFile = 1  -  the current directly is set to %TEMP%


 HotKey
 ------
   Specifies the plugin hotkey which calls the "Execute..." dialog.
   Available values are: F1, F2, F3 ... F12.


 ToolbarBtn
 ----------
   ToolbarBtn = 0  -  no toolbar button;
   ToolbarBtn = 1  -  the toolbar button shows the Console window;
   ToolbarBtn = 2  -  the toolbar button calls the "Execute..." dialog.
   ToolbarBtn = 3  -  the toolbar button directly executes last script.
   ToolbarBtn = 4  -  the toolbar button executes the selected text.


 WatchScriptFile
 ---------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), the plugin rereads the file
   with saved scripts if its time stamp has been changed. The plugin
   checks the file time stamp when you call the "Execute..." dialog.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), the plugin does not check
   the file time stamp and does not reread this file.


 SaveLastScript
 --------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), the plugin saves the last
   executed script to "npes_saved.txt" and restores it when Notepad++
   starts. (So it can be run by Execute Previous NppExec Script).
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), the plugin does not save the
   last executed script and does not read "npes_saved.txt" when Notepad++
   starts.
   See also: LastScriptFile.


 ScriptNppStart
 --------------
   You can specify here a name of existing script which you want to be
   executed each time when Notepad++ starts.
   For example, this script can contain declarations of your own variables
   (using SET command), some welcome messages (using ECHO command) or
   whatever command(s) you want.
   Note: if you specify an empty value or non-existent script name for
   this option, no script will be executed when Notepad++ starts.
   See also: ScriptNppExit.


 ScriptNppExit
 -------------
   You can specify here a name of existing script which you want to be
   executed each time when Notepad++ exits.
   Note: if you specify an empty value or non-existent script name for
   this option, no script will be executed when Notepad++ exits.
   See also: ScriptNppStart.


 HelpFile
 --------
   Relative pathname to NppExec's help file (manual).
   This pathname is relative to location of the "NppExec.dll" file.
   Usually "NppExec.dll" is located somewhere in "...\Notepad++\plugins",
   and the help file is located in "...\Notepad++\plugins\doc\NppExec" so
   its relative pathname is "doc\NppExec\NppExec_Manual.chm".
   You can specify different file name and/or extension here.
   Also you can specify absolute pathname (e.g. C:\docs\NppExec.chm).
   You can use some of macro-variables as the part of this pathname.
   The supported macro-variables are:
     $(SYS.TEMP)
     $(NPP_DIRECTORY)
     $(PLUGINS_CONFIG_DIR)


 TempScriptFile
 --------------
   Name of a file where NppExec stores its temporary script.
   The default file name is "npes_temp.txt".


 LastScriptFile
 --------------
   Name of a file where NppExec stores its last executed script.
   The default file name is "npes_last.txt".
   See also: SaveLastScript.


 SavedScriptsFile
 ----------------
   Name of a file where NppExec stores its saved scripts.
   The default file name is "npes_saved.txt".


 LogsDir
 -------
   Relative or absolute directory (folder) to store NppExec's log files.
   The default empty value means the log files are not created.
   When relative dir is specified, NppExec constructs the full path to
   the log files as "%TEMP%\<LogsDir>\<NppExecDllName>\<YYYY_MM_DD>",
   e.g. "C:\Temp\<LogsDir>\NppExec\2013_09_28".
   (If the %TEMP% environment variable does not exist, NppExec uses the
    path of $(PLUGINS_CONFIG_DIR) instead.)
   When full path is specified, NppExec constructs the full path to the
   log files as "<LogsDir>\<NppExecDllName>\<YYYY_MM_DD>".
   You can use some of macro-variables as the part of this pathname.
   The supported macro-variables are:
     $(SYS.TEMP)             (as well as any other environment variable)
     $(NPP_DIRECTORY)
     $(PLUGINS_CONFIG_DIR)
   NOTE:
   When <LogsDir> is specified, the internal Logger produces some more
   information than in its default mode, so you can observe more details.


 AutoSave_Seconds
 ----------------
   !!! This option is EXPERIMENTAL and therefore disabled by default !!!
   (Due to its current implementation, there may be issues with today's
   multi-core processors. For example, some value may be saved during
   the time while it is being modified - thus leading to saving of the
   unexpected content.)
   Specifies the interval in seconds of auto-saving of NppExec's options.
   For example, the value of 300 means once per 300 seconds (i.e. once per
   5 minutes).
   The value of 0 disables the auto-saving.


 CompilerErrors
 --------------
   Enables or disables the built-in highlight filter that catches and
   highlights most of compilers' errors. This filter has lower priority
   than the user-defined highlight masks.
   Can be enabled/disabled via "npe_console x+/x-".
