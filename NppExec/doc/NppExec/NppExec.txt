 *  HISTORY  *
 *************

 v0.6 RC2 - June 2018
 --------------------
 + new environment variables: $(CLIPBOARD_TEXT), $(NPP_HWND), $(SCI_HWND)
 + new commands: clip_settext, messagebox, exit, npe_sendmsgbuflen
 + set <var> ~ strlensci <string>
 * internal improvements
 + the NppExec Manual has been updated


 v0.6 RC1 - May 2018
 -------------------
 ! NppExec's help files were moved from "doc\*.*" to "doc\NppExec\*.*"
 + new command: npp_setfocus
 + Plugin Interface: new messages NPEM_GETSCRIPTNAMES, NPEM_GETSCRIPTBYNAME
 * now the actual name of NppExec.dll affects the "NppExec" submenu and its "Show Console" item name
 * various small improvements


 v0.6 beta 1 - February 2018
 ---------------------------
 * changed: now the Execute dialog's auto-completion pop-up uses the same upper/lower case
   as the first character of a word being typed (e.g. Npp -> NPP...; npp -> npp...);
   also: now the auto-completion pop-up's height is limited by the number of its items
 + new commands: SCI_FIND, SCI_REPLACE
 + new commands: TEXT_SAVETO, TEXT_LOADFROM
 + Function Parser has been updated to support the bitwise operators: ~, |, &, << and >>
   (thanks to Juha Nieminen and Joel Yliluoma for their advice)
 + $(LAST_CMD_RESULT) - result of the last NppExec's command (1 - succeeded, 0 - failed, -1 - invalid arg)
 - fixed: parameters of sci_sendmsg/npp_sendmsg were truncated to 32-bit in 64-bit NppExec
 - fixed: now pasting to the Console via Shift+Insert is equal to Ctrl+V


 v0.6 alpha 1 - December 2017
 ----------------------------
 1. Project infrastructure updated:
    ! Now NppExec uses C++11 and requires at least VS 2013 Express
    ! 32-bit NppExec targets Windows XP SP3 and higher (because of new VS C++ compiler)
    + Project file for Visual Studio 2013 Express (NppExec_VC12.sln)
    + Project file for Visual Studio 2015 Express (NppExec_VC14.sln)
    + NppExec can be build with Orwell Dev-C++ (NppExec_DevCpp.dev)
    + 64-bit ready (the 64-bit NppExec targets Windows 7 x64 and higher)
 2. Third-party components updated:
    + fparser updated to 4.5.2
    + Notepad++ and Scintilla header files updated to Notepad++ 7.5.1
 3. Scripting abilities enhanced:
    + added: "nppexec:" prefix to execute NppExec's commands from a child console process
    + added: "nppexec::" prefix to execute NppExec's command always in a collateral script
    + added: "@EXIT_CMD" and "@EXIT_CMD_SILENT" macro vars to specify child process'es exit command
      (type "help @exit_cmd" in the Console for details)
    + added: $(PID) macro var, e.g. to be able to "nppexec:taskkill /pid $(PID)"
    + new commands: NPP_SAVEAS, PROC_SIGNAL, SLEEP, NPE_QUEUE
    + set <var> ~ strfromhex <hex string>
    + set <var> ~ strtohex <string>
    + now IF...ELSE IF...ELSE...ENDIF sequences are supported (see "help if")
    + now commands can be executed from macro-vars (e.g. "set a = npp_run calc" and then "$(a)" to execute)
    + now a child console process is tried to be killed first, and only then terminated
    + now "set local" in NppExec's Console creates Console's local vars (not shared with NppExec's script)
    + NppExec's Plugin Interface has been enhanced; NppExecPluginMsgTester has been updated
 4. Improved and fixed:
    + Warning Analyser: more accurate detection of %LINE% and %CHAR%
    + NppExec's Console: Tab-completion improved; also works after "help " and "nppexec:"
    + NppExec's Console: "Tab = \t" allows to type Tab character in the Console
    + now SEL_LOADFROM and CON_LOADFROM detect UTF-8 without BOM
    + now SEL_SAVETO can save as UTF-8 without BOM
    - fixed: font of NppExec's Console could be set incorrectly
    - fixed: crash while calculating very big numbers (e.g. 10^72)
    - fixed: the "exit command" dialog did not use the "Key_Enter" value
    - fixed: now pasting (Ctrl+V) to the Console clears the text formatting
    - fixed: now the Console Filters masks' length is not limited by the edit controls' width
    - fixed: double-click on word-wrapped errors and warnings did not work in the Console
    * plugin's core has been rewritten (the layer of the CNppExecCommandExecutor)
    * other internal improvements
    * even more other internal improvements
    * better error reporting
    * output is suppressed while Notepad++ is exiting (applies to the exit script)
 5. Highlights:
    * The "nppexec:" prefix allows to execute NppExec's commands while working
      with a child console process (e.g. you can start cmd in NppExec's Console
      and type "nppexec: set local @exit_cmd = exit" in cmd's prompt or even
      type "nppexec: taskkill /pid $(PID)" to kill the cmd.exe). The command
      that is executed in such way is an example of so-called collateral
      NppExec's script. (It's collateral because it is executed while a child
      console process is already executing.)
    * The "nppexec::" prefix always starts a collateral (parallel) NppExec's
      script to execute the given command. Even if there is no child process or
      script running in NppExec, this prefix forces a collateral script to be
      created to execute the command.
    * All these variables are local now (similar to "set local"):
      - $(INPUT), $(INPUT[N])
      - $(OUTPUT), $(OUTPUT1), $(OUTPUTL)
      - $(EXITCODE), $(PID)
      - $(MSG_RESULT), $(MSG_WPARAM), $(MSG_LPARAM)
      Now, with collateral scripts, it makes perfect sense to make these
      variables to be local - as they are rather unique for each NppExec's
      script than to NppExec as a whole. (Any NppExec's script can call
      "inputbox", start a child process, send a message - and there is no
      sense to share the resulting variables with all the other scripts.)
    * NPE_CMDALIAS and NPE_QUEUE have additional parameters to enable/disable
      the delayed variables substitution. NPE_QUEUE additionally has a parameter
      that controls whether the queued command will be executed as a separate
      NppExec's script (similar to NPEM_EXECUTE_QUEUED) or not.
      Type "help npe_cmdalias" and "help npe_queue" in NppExec's Console for
      details.
    * NppExec's Plugin Interface has been enhanced; the NppExecPluginMsgTester
      has been updated correspondingly.
    * Now there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of NppExec.
    * More than 10 years of NppExec! :)

 TODO:

 - update the NppExec Manual (currently it's incomplete, see below)

 - NppExec Manual - add info about opening files ( https://sourceforge.net/p/npp-plugins/discussion/672146/thread/b50394f7/ )
   - add info about @exit_cmd ( https://sourceforge.net/p/npp-plugins/discussion/672146/thread/da49de3c/
                                https://sourceforge.net/p/npp-plugins/discussion/672146/thread/c2179f6d/
                              )
   - add info about NppExec Console colours ( https://sourceforge.net/p/npp-plugins/discussion/672146/thread/c2179f6d/ )
   - other interesting info:
     https://sourceforge.net/p/npp-plugins/discussion/672146/thread/b50394f7/
     https://github.com/d0vgan/nppexec/issues/4
     https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15804/macro-delete-lines-that-contains-text-in-clipboard
   - FAQ section?

 - callback scripts? (though, we already have NppEventExec)

 - PrintOutput: add support of "ESC ]" and "ESC [" sequences;
   correspondingly, use CHARFORMAT2 to set both Text and Background color.
   This probably will not be included in v0.6 (requires noticeable time for development & testing).

 - Idea: add "local" keyword for _everything_, i.e. including env_set, con_colour, npp_console, npe_console, ...
   It will mean: this change is local within the script - and when the script ends, everything will be restored
   as it was before the "local" command was applied.
   This will need implementation of "Undo" or "State" logic for all commands.
   Extremally time-consuming, though. Probably will remain just an idea.


 v0.5.3 - February 2015
 ----------------------
 + new menu items "Go to next error" and "Go to previous error" (based on
   the HighLight masks), thanks to mrmixer
 + now %FILE% is treated as both %ABSFILE% and %FILE%, so there's no need
   to duplicate the masks with %ABSFILE% and %FILE%
 + maximum number of user menu items increased to 100 (was 40)
 + when npes_saved.txt is saved, its previous version is kept as .bak
 + TAB navigation works in Filter/Replace/HighLight dialog
 + now the INPUTBOX command can accept 3 parameters
 + NppExec Manual updated
 + other small improvements


 v0.5.2.2 - December 2014
 ------------------------
 + now the IF-GOTO statement supports floating-point comparison as well
   (e.g. IF 2.5 < 10.1 GOTO Label2)
 + new advanced option "Console_NulChar" (enhancing v0.5.2.1)
 * 8 years since NppExec was born! :)


 v0.5.2.1 - November 2014
 ------------------------
 + Now NppExec is able to deal with NUL ('\0') character when external
   application outputs it to the Console:
   (Unicode) 0x0000 "NUL" is replaced with 0x25E6 "White Bullet";
   (ANSI) 0x00 "NUL" is replaced with 0x17 "End of Text Block".
 + NppExec Manual updated a little bit.
 * The "Donate..." button has been removed. Since I did not receive any
   donation - either due to ukrainian politics/restrictions as for PayPal
   or due to lack of donations itself - and since this situation is unlikely
   to change, the button has been removed.
   You can always donate to Notepad++ itself.

 v0.2 RC1 - December 2007
 ------------------------
 1. A lot of internal changes/improvements.
 In particular, now all plugin's options are stored, read and written by the
 Options Manager component.
 The Warning Analyzer component, developed by Nicolas Babled, allows to filter
 and recognize different compiler/interpretter error and warning messages - and
 extract useful information from these messages (such as file name and line
 number).
 The Simple Logger component stores detailed information about last executed
 command (can be usefull for "debugging").
 * The console redirecting engine has been improved.
 * Now the plugin identifies itself by its dll-file name. Each copy of the
 plugin (each dll-file) stores its options in corresponding ini-file.
 * Now plugin's environment variables (e.g. "$(FILE_NAME)") are available for
 child console process. For example, start "cmd.exe" and type "echo $(#1)".
 * Now system's environment variables are available in a form of "$(SYS.<var>)"
 e.g. "$(SYS.WINDIR)", "$(SYS.TEMP)" etc.
 * Now the NPP_EXEC command can pass arguments to the script. These arguments
 can be accessed in the script through the following macro-variables:
 $(ARGC), $(ARGV), $(ARGV[n]).
 Example:  npp_exec "script name" param_1 "param 2".
 This example sets the following values for the script:
 $(ARGC) = 3;  $(ARGV) = param_1 "param 2";  $(ARGV[0]) = script name;
 $(ARGV[1]) = param_1;  $(ARGV[2]) = param 2.
 * Each command now have detailed help information. Type "help" or "help help"
 in the NppExec's Console.
 * Now the console commands history is restored when you restart Notepad++.

 2. New menu items:
 (Thanks to Nicolas Babled & Geert Vancompernolle)
 Direct Execute Previous - directly executes previous script.
 No internal messages - do not show such messages as "Process started >>>", etc.
 Save all files on execute - saves all files before executing a script.
 Also NppExec's toolbar icon has been added.

 3. New dialog:  Console Output Filter -> Highlight.
 (Thanks to Nicolas Babled & Geert Vancompernolle)
 This dialog allows you to specify a string mask for compiler/interpretter error
 and warning messages with such keywords as %FILE%, %ABSFILE% and %LINE%.
 These messages can be highlighted with different colours and allow you to go
 to certain line in certain file when double-clicked in the Console window.

 4. New messages:
 NPP_SAVEALL - saves all modified files.
 CON_LOADFROM - loads a file's content to the Console.
 CON_SAVETO - saves the Console's content to a file.
 ECHO - prints a text in the Console (supports internal env. variables)
 SET - sets the value of user's variable
 UNSET - removes user's variable


 v0.2 beta4 - July 2007
 ----------------------

 - fixed/added: '\b' and '\r' handling
 + a lot of changes in plugin's internals (basic cpp-classes and NppExecEngine)

 + new feature: npp_open <mask>, npp_open <path\mask>

 * thanks to all who wait for this version

 -----------------------
 + Menu: Console Commands History.
     When enabled, previous commands can be scrolled by pressing
     arrow keys Up and Down.
 + Menu: Console Output Filter.
     When enabled, output messages from running console process
     can be filtered (i.e. particular lines can be excluded)
 - ConsoleDlg: Ctrl+A is unlocked
 - ConsoleDlg: Quotes "" are no more added automatically for paths
     with spaces (because of a bug with executables w/o extension
     such as "cmd /c calc.exe")
