      It allows to run external tool/compiler directly from Notepad++.</p>

      output, and can redirect the Console window's input to the running process
      (with some limitations).</p>
  <p>+ NppExec is an interpreter of its own internal commands. NppExec can
      execute several commands one after another (so-called NppExec's script)
      from its &quot;Execute NppExec Script...&quot; dialog and can execute
      single command or multiple commands directly from its Console window.</p>
