<h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>

<p><b>Q1. Why program output is wrong in NppExec?</b></p>
<p>To answer this question, let's mention the most common problems one may face in NppExec's Console first:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NppExec's Console does not show any output until a program exits;</li>
  <li>NppExec's Console does not show any prompt when a program waits for user input;</li>
  <li>NppExec's Console shows program's output with incorrect indentations or colors;</li>
  <li>NppExec's Console shows program's output with unexpected characters;</li>
  <li>NppExec's Console shows program's output with <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> mixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, you are surely thinking: quite a few problems, man! Why have you introduced them?</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you: this is not something intended. This is a limitation of the technique that NppExec uses to capture program's output.</p>
<p>In short, NppExec does not use a real console (also known as &quot;terminal&quot;). Instead, NppExec uses pipes to &quot;communicate&quot; with an external program. And sometimes, depending on a program, these pipes do not work as expected. Technical details are explained in <a href="4.8.3.html">[4.8.3]</a>, from the point (6).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are workarounds for these issues which are explained below, in <b>Q3</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q2. Why NppExec does not use real console (terminal)?</b></p>
<p>Very good question!</p>
<p>I'll try to give a good answer.</p>
<p>The main purpose of NppExec is its deep integration with Notepad++. NppExec achieves it by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>supporting Notepad++'s and own variables such as <i>$(FILE_NAME)</i>, <i>$(CWD)</i> and so on;</li>
  <li>supporting various commands such as <i>npp_save</i>, <i>sci_sendmsg</i> and so on;</li>
  <li>working with the text in Notepad++'s editing window (also with the selected text);</li>
  <li>invoking external programs to alter the text in Notepad++'s editing window;</li>
  <li>highlighting warnings and errors in a program's output;</li>
  <li>automate certain actions in Notepad++ by means of NppExec's scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is not possible in a real console. Because there is no connection between a real console and Notepad++. A real console does not know anything about <i>$(FILE_NAME)</i>; it can't save a file in Notepad++; it can not alter the text selected in Notepad++; it can not produce clickable warnings and errors allowing to go to the corresponding file and line in Notepad++. And so on. Different tools, different abilities.</p>
<p>So, NppExec provides some benefits with respect to integration with Notepad++, but lacks some benefits of the real console. Well, some sort of trade-off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q3. How can I get proper program output in NppExec?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is: run this program using the system's command-line interpreter which is <i>cmd.exe</i>. As NppExec lacks the features of the real console, the logical solution is to execute a program in a separate console window.</p>
<p>There are two ways to achieve this:</p>
<p><u>1. Using <i>npp_run</i>:</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>npp_run program.exe</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This runs a program <i>program.exe</i> in a separate window (not in NppExec's Console). In this case, NppExec does not have any control over the <i>program.exe</i> - it does not know if the program is running or has it finished.</p>
<p>To run the program with arguments such as <i>arg1</i> and <i>arg 2</i>, use:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>npp_run program.exe arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><u>2. Using <i>cmd /C start /wait</i>:</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C start /wait &quot;some title&quot; program.exe</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, <i>cmd</i> itself is running within NppExec's Console, so NppExec waits until the <i>cmd</i> is finished. In the same time, <i>start /wait</i> instructs the <i>cmd</i> to run the <i>program.exe</i> in a separate window and wait until the <i>program.exe</i> is finished.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, we have the <i>program.exe</i> running in its own window and NppExec's Console waiting for the <i>program.exe</i> to finish. This is the advantage of <i>cmd /C start /wait</i> over <i>npp_run</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>&quot;some title&quot;</i> is the title of the console window started by the <i>cmd /C start /wait</i>.</p>
<p>To run the program with arguments such as <i>arg1</i> and <i>arg 2</i>, use:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C start /wait &quot;some title&quot; program.exe arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what if <i>program.exe</i> exits too fast - and, instead, we want its console output to remain until we read it? In such case, we are adding another explicit usage of <i>cmd /C</i>, this time calling it with <i>pause</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C start /wait &quot;some title&quot; cmd /C &quot;program.exe arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot; &amp;&amp; pause&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, let's consider a more complicated scenario. What if we want to compile a file currently opened in Notepad++ and then to run the produced executable with some arguments? To do that, the following commands can be used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>npp_save  // save the current file
cd $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)  // cd to the directory of the current file
npe_console local -- x+  // enable the built-in error highlight filter
compiler.exe &quot;$(FILE_NAME)&quot;  // compile the current file in NppExec's Console
if $(EXITCODE) != 0 then  // check the compiler's exit code
  exit  // the compiler did not succeed, no sense to continue
endif
cmd /C start /wait &quot;$(NAME_PART)&quot; &quot;$(NAME_PART).exe&quot; arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot;  // run the compiled file
npp_setfocus con  // return the focus back to NppExec's Console</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequence of the commands above is called <i>NppExec's script</i> <a href="3.7.html">[3.7]</a>.</p>
<p>To run the compiled file (executable) and preserve its console output, use the same technique with <i>cmd /C</i> and <i>pause</i> as shown above:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C start /wait &quot;$(NAME_PART)&quot; cmd /C &quot;&quot;$(NAME_PART).exe&quot; arg1 &quot;arg 2&quot; &amp;&amp; pause&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q4. Why output redirection and command chaining do not work in NppExec?</b></p>
<p>They actually work by means of the system's command-line interpreter which is <i>cmd.exe</i>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C program.exe &gt;program.txt</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and also:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cmd /C start /wait &quot;example&quot; cmd /C &quot;echo Hello world! &amp;&amp; pause&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See more examples in <a href="4.4.html">[4.4]</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q5. How can I compile my source code in NppExec?</b></p>
<p>In short, you need two things: a proper compiler for your programming language and a proper way of using this compiler by means of NppExec.</p>
<p>In general, each programming language and each compiler requires its own approach. The <b>Q3</b> above briefly mentions a template of <i>NppExec's script</i> <a href="3.7.html">[3.7]</a> that compiles the current file and runs the produced executable.</p>
<p>Please refer to other sections of the NppExec Manual to get an idea of how to compile the source code for the programming language you are interested in. In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to compiling/interpreting/etc. <a href="4.0.html">[4.0]</a>;</li>
  <li>Running Python & wxPython <a href="4.6.4.html">[4.6.4]</a>;</li>
  <li>Run and terminate PowerShell process <a href="4.6.7.html">[4.6.7]</a>;</li>
  <li>Running Lua <a href="4.6.10.html">[4.6.10]</a>;</li>
  <li>Compiling simple C and Pas-programs <a href="4.7.1.html">[4.7.1]</a>;</li>
  <li>Compiling Java <a href="4.7.2.html">[4.7.2]</a>;</li>
  <li>Using Visual Studio's compiler (cl.exe) <a href="4.7.3.html">[4.7.3]</a>;</li>
  <li>Compiling ANY source file <a href="4.7.4.html">[4.7.4]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q6. Why NppExec echoes each input command?</b></p>
<p>By default, NppExec echoes each input command in green color (which corresponds to TextColorMessage in NppExec's Advanced Options). This is the NppExec's way to confirm that an input command has been received and is being processed.</p>
<p>You can disable this echoing either from NppExec's plugin menu <a href="3.4.html">[3.4]</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>check &quot;No internal messages&quot; under Plugins -&gt; NppExec;</li>
</ul>
<p>or programmatically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>execute this command:
  <blockquote>
    <pre>npe_console -- m-</pre>
  </blockquote>
  (for details, type &quot;help npe_console&quot; in NppExec's Console).</li>
</ul>
<p>Another potential source of echoed commands is <i>cmd.exe</i> running in NppExec's Console. In such case, just add the <code>/Q</code> switch to <i>cmd.exe</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>cmd /Q</pre>
  </blockquote>
<p>In this case, <i>cmd.exe</i> will not echo its input commands.</p>
